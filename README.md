### ARK.AI - Open Distributed A.I.

### Mission:

ARK.AI's mission is to help create an Open Distributed AI by bringing toghether and interconnecting separate narrow AI agents.  

### Inspiration:

The human brain has regions specialized for certain things but each part of the brain intercommunicates to create an intelligent being. 

Today there are many anvances in the AI field and there are many AI services/agents out there that somewhat resemble specialized regions of the brain but there is no intercommunication between those agents since they are offered behind "walled gardens".

What we are proposing is the creation of an Open Source Distributed AI where anyone who create an AI agent is able to easely intercommunicate and share skills with other AI agents inside the Open Distributed AI. 
We are also proposing the creation of open standards for easy payments between A.I. agents and between AI agents and potential outside services using the skills offered by the AI agents inside the Open Distributed AI. 

### Benefits:

1. By adopting open standards, each AI agent will be easier to use by other AI agents and services. 
2. Individual AI agents will be easier to discover and bennefit by the network effect.
3. Many narrow AI agents can be brought together to form more advanced AI agents.

### Goals:

1. Anyone should be able to build AI agents with skills that can be accessed by other AI agents inside the Open Distributed AI.
2. Create open standards for allowing individual AI Agents to easely interface with the Open Distributed AI.
3. Create a reputation systems for rating individual AI agents.
4. Any AI agent should be able to provide skills for a fee or for free. This implies the creation of open standards for inter AI agent payments or for outside services which will use the skills provided by the AI agents.
