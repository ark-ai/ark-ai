### ARK.AI - An Open Source Distributed A.I.
 
ARK.AI is the quest for creating a global, open source distributed A.I. (Aritificial Intelligence).

### Goal:

##### Create open standards and open source resilient distributed peer-to-peer networks where:

1. A specialised A.I. agent can share its skills with other specialised A.I. agents in the network.
2. A specialised A.I. agent can use the skills provided by other specialised A.I. agents in the network.
3. Create a reputation system where only A.I. agents with high reputation can be trusted and used.
