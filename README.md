### ARK.AI - Open Source Distributed A.I.
 
ARK.AI is the quest for creating an Open Source Distributed A.I.

### Inspiration:

The human brain has regions specialized for certain things but each part of the brain intercommunicates to create an intelligent being. 

Today there are many anvances in the A.I. field and there are many A.I. services/agents out there that somewhat resemble specialized regions of the brain but there is no intercommunication between those agents since they are offered behind "walled gardens".

What we are proposing is the creation of an Open Source Distributed A.I. where anyone who creates A.I. agents should be able to easely intercommunicate and share skills with other A.I. agents inside the distributed A.I.. We are also proposing the creation of open standards for easy payments between A.I. agents and between A.I. agents and potential services using the skills offered by the A.I. agents. 

### Goals:

1. Anyone should be able to build A.I. agents with skills that can be accessed by other A.I. agents inside the Open Distributed AI.
2. Create open standards for allowing individual A.I. Agents to easely interface with the Open Distributed AI.
3. Create a reputation systems for rating individual A.I. agents.
4. Any AI agent should be able to provide skills for a fee or for free. This implies the creation of open standards for inter A.I. agent payments or for outside services which will use the skills.
